    <p class="text_column">Over the past few years as technology advance, new technology which is unfamiliar emerges and begins to be used by itself or implemented with technology we use today.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; </p>
    <p class="text_column">A concept like this explores how technology is changing now and is going to change in the future to tend to specifications of a client and complete tasks in a more effective manner than current devices or technology.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; </p>
    <p class="text_column">Traditionally, these development trends follow specific specification based areas such as CPU power and output, device size, memory and screen resolution but, as of late, an array of interesting trends have emerged whcih stray from traditional lines such as biometric security, voice acivation/voice control and the increasing number of cameras.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; </p>

      <p>When Looking for a phon, many consider the quality of it's camera. The current batch of I-Phones for example have multiple camera lenses which all in all create clutter on the back of the phone. In the future some form of adaptive lens technology will be implemented&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; </p>

      <h3>CURRENT EMERGING TREND 2: VIRTUAL REALITY</h3>
      <img src="img/ET_vr.jpg" alt="" width="400" height="200" class="cards"/>
      <p>VR is a computer generated environment with scenes and objects that appear to be real creating a sense of immersivenes. VR technology is still relatively new and with further development, it could be used to simulate situations like surgeries or other dangerous jobs to precise detail so VR can be used as a practice tool.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; </p>
