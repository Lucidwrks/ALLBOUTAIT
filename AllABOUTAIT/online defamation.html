    <p class="text_column">If someone causes harm to your reputation by publishing material about you that changes the way people feel about you, you may have been harmed in a legal sense. Not all offensive, embarrassing or upsetting remarks cause harm to your reputation. </p>
    <p class="text_column">Broadly, defamation is the spreading of false information which damages someones reputation. Defamation in an online context is difficult to define and even more difficult to police. As easy to see, the general definition of defamation applies directly to online communities that are populated by trolls, cyberbullies and catfishers. </p>
    <p class="text_column">One of difficulties with traditional defamation understandings is that they are based in an understanding that they are based in an understanding that the originator of the false information is easily identifiable , however in a online world this can be difficult </p>
